I have access to AD users and computers, I would need to get my admin login from my job when hired in order to start troubleshootings users passwords, other then that I have the process of ultimately reseting their passwords. 
<p>  
</p><p> </p>
Reseting users passwords:    <p> </p>                                                                                 1. Right click the users name   <p> </p>                                                                              
2. Click reset password <p> </p>
3. Create a generic password for them and unlcock user account <p/> </p> 
4. Click ok, a pop up comes up saying the password has been changed, click ok again <p/> <p/> 
5. Inform the user of the password I created for them to log in, they will be able to access their account again to created a new password that only they know.
